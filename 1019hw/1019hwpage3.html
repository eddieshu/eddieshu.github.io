    <h3>Embracing Singularity</h3>
    <p id="cool">
        Today, they work and live together in Lisbon; prior to this move, their careers spanned Beijing and New York, Shigeru Ban Architects and Pierre Yovanovitch’s studio. “After working for many years for various architects and interior designers in France and abroad, and following the birth of our daughter, we were at a turning point in our professional and personal lives,” remembers Dimofski. <em>“We are adventurous by nature, and it was time for a new challenge.”</em> In 2021, the couple chose to settle down in Lisbon and envisioned the genesis of their gallery and multi-disciplinary design studio. “We wanted to work with local craftsmen and export this knowledge worldwide,” says Garcé, who, as a child, used to spend summers with his family in Portugal.

    <h4>The show at <em>Graça Convent unfolded</em> like a story</h4>

        Ahead of launching their showroom in summer 2022, the duo have laid the foundations for this new phase with an installation in Lisbon’s historic Graça Convent. The exhibition, titled “Mensagem” — derived from one of Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa’s major works — offered a glimpse into Garcé & Dimofski’s practice, which focusses on creative collaboration. “Navigating between art and design is what defines us,” says Dimofski. “We don’t understand our work in terms of a particular style, but rather as a constantly changing language, influenced by the craftsmen we work with.”
